Title: Meta-analysis of the Difference Between Two Treatments in iNterpolation and EXTrapolation for Beta Diversity Across Three Dimensions
Version: 1.0.0
Author: MingYun Yang
Maintainer: MingYun Yang <myyang@gapp.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: Provides functions to compute the difference between two treatments in taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity (3D) at a standardized sample coverage across alpha, beta, and gamma diversity levels, as well as dissimilarity and turnover indices. This package also includes tools to conduct meta-analysis and generate forest plots for visualizing the results.
