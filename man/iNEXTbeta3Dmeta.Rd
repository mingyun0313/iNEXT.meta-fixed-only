\usage{
iNEXTbeta3Dmeta(
  data,
  diversity = "TD",
  order.q = 0,
  datatype = "abundance",
  level = NULL,
  nboot = 10,
  treatment_order,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Same structure as \code{iNEXT.beta3D}; for \code{datatype = "abundance"}, the first two columns are site and treatment;
for \code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}, the first three columns are site, treatment, and patch.}

\item{diversity}{'TD', 'PD', or 'FD'.}

\item{order.q}{Numeric vector of diversity orders (e.g., \code{c(0,1,2)}).}

\item{datatype}{"abundance" or "incidence_raw".}

\item{level}{Sample-coverage level in [0,1]. If \code{NULL}, the function uses the minimum coverage achieved at
double the reference sample size across all site × treatment combinations.}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap replications for uncertainty.}

\item{treatment_order}{Character vector of length 2 specifying the treatment order; differences are computed as
\code{treatment_order[1] - treatment_order[2]}.}

\item{conf}{Confidence level (default 0.95).}

\item{PDtree, PDreftime, PDtype, FDdistM, FDtype, FDtau, FDcut_number}{As in \code{iNEXT.beta3D}.}
}
\value{
A list with seven components: \code{Summary_Gamma}, \code{Summary_Alpha}, \code{Summary_Beta},
\code{Summary_1-C}, \code{Summary_1-U}, \code{Summary_1-V}, and \code{Summary_1-S}. Each component contains:
(1) a data frame of site-level differences (with SE, CI, weights) plus a fixed-effect combined row, and
(2) a one-row meta summary with Cochran’s Q (\code{Q_val}), degrees of freedom (\code{df_val}),
p-value (\code{p_val}), and heterogeneity percentage (\code{I2_val}).
}
\description{
\code{iNEXTbeta3Dmeta} estimates the difference of standardized 3D (taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional)
diversity between two treatments (e.g., Enhanced vs. Control) and synthesizes results across sites using a
fixed-effect model.
