\title{Forest plot of the standardized 3D diversity difference (fixed effect)}
\usage{
ggiNEXTmeta(output, q, num_round = 3, range, type = NULL, level = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{The output from \code{iNEXTbeta3Dmeta}.}

\item{q}{A value of \code{Order.q} present in \code{output}.}

\item{num_round}{Number of decimal places shown.}

\item{range}{Optional lower/upper bounds to clip CIs (pass to \code{forestplot}'s \code{clip}; commented out by default).}

\item{type}{One of "Gamma", "Alpha", "Beta", "1-C", "1-U", "1-V", or "1-S".}

\item{level}{Optional sample coverage (in percent) to annotate in the title; if \code{NULL}, no annotation is added.}
}
\value{
A forest plot showing site-level differences and the fixed-effect combined estimate.
}
\description{
\code{ggiNEXTmeta} draws a forest plot for the difference of standardized 3D diversity between two treatments,
summarized using a fixed-effect model.
